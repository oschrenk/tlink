<h3 align="center">tlink</h3>
<p align="center">Jump to any tmux session, window, or pane from a URL.</p>

---

```
open tmux://<session>/<window>/<pane>
```

`tlink` registers the `tmux://` URI scheme and routes clicks to the exact pane — flashing the border and showing a status-bar toast on arrival. It also ships notification addons that ping you when an AI coding agent finishes a task.

> **Ghostty note:** Ghostty doesn't expose an API to focus a specific tab or open a new window with a command without triggering a macOS security dialog. When you click a `tmux://` link, it works the same as other terminals (switches the session in place), but if you're in a different tab you'll need to switch to the tmux tab manually.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahnopologetic/tlink/main/install.sh | sh
```

Detects your OS and architecture, installs to `~/.local/bin`, and adds it to your PATH. No sudo required.

**From source**
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/ahnopologetic/tlink
```

## Setup (macOS)

```bash
tlink setup
```

Runs a TUI wizard that picks your terminal emulator, compiles a minimal Swift handler app, and registers the `tmux://` scheme with macOS. Takes ~30 seconds, run once.

> Linux: URI scheme registration is macOS-only. `tlink open` (pane navigation) and the notification addon work on Linux without setup.

## Usage

### Click a link (from anywhere)

Once `tlink setup` is done, any `tmux://` link is clickable — in Slack, in a browser, in a chat app, wherever. macOS routes it through TmuxLink.app and into `tlink open`.

```bash
# Click these from anywhere — they open in your terminal
tmux://mysession
tmux://mysession/work
tmux://mysession/work/1
```

Links target three levels of specificity:

| Target | Example | What happens |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Session | `tmux://work` | Switches to the `work` session |
| Session + window | `tmux://work/editor` | Switches to window `editor` in `work` |
| Session + window + pane | `tmux://work/editor/0` | Switches to pane 0 in `editor` |

**Custom server socket:** if your tmux server runs on a named socket (`tmux -L <name>`), append `?socket=<name>` and tlink passes it through as `tmux -L <name>` on every command:

```
tmux://work/editor/0?socket=dev
```

The notification addons detect the socket automatically, so links they generate already point at the right server.

If you're already in tmux, the current pane switches to the target and flashes green. A status-bar toast confirms the jump:

```
[tlink] tlink → work:editor.0
```

If no tmux client is attached (you clicked the link from outside a terminal), `tlink` falls back to asking your terminal to open a new window running `tmux attach-session -t <session>`. This works on Terminal.app, iTerm2, Kitty, and WezTerm.

### Run from a terminal

```bash
# Direct open — same as clicking a link
tlink open "tmux://mysession"

# Or use macOS open command
tlink open "tmux://mysession/work/1"
```

### Notification addons

When an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi) finishes a task, tlink can ping you with a desktop notification:

```bash
tlink install claude-notification
tlink install pi-notification
tlink install --interactive
```

The notification includes a clickable deeplink back to the session, window, and pane where the agent was running. See [Addons](#addons) below.

### Telemetry

```bash
tlink telemetry status      # Check current setting
tlink telemetry enable      # Opt in (anonymous usage data)
tlink telemetry disable     # Opt out
```

Activity events are written locally to `~/.local/share/tlink/telemetry/events.jsonl`. If a Sentry DSN is configured (set `TLINK_SENTRY_DSN` at build time), errors and activity are sent to Sentry for diagnostics.

### Diagnostics

```bash
tlink status     # Registration state + active tmux sessions
tlink doctor     # Run all diagnostic checks
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |

| `tlink setup` | Register the `tmux://` URI scheme (macOS) |
| `tlink open <uri>` | Navigate to a tmux pane |
| `tlink install claude-notification` | Install the Claude Code notification addon |
| `tlink install codex-notification` | Install the Codex CLI notification addon |
| `tlink install gemini-notification` | Install the Gemini CLI notification addon |
| `tlink install pi-notification` | Install the Pi agent notification addon |
| `tlink install --interactive` | Interactive add-on selector (multi-select) |
| `tlink delete <addon>` | Remove a notification addon |
| `tlink telemetry status` | Show telemetry setting |
| `tlink telemetry enable` | Opt into anonymous usage data |
| `tlink telemetry disable` | Opt out |
| `tlink status` | Show registration state and active sessions |

| `tlink restart` | Re-register the URI handler |

## Addons

## Uninstall

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahnopologetic/tlink/main/uninstall.sh | sh
```

Removes:

| What | Location |
|---|---|
| Binary | `~/.local/bin/tlink` |
| Config | `~/.config/tlink/` (includes hook scripts) |
| Telemetry data | `~/.local/share/tlink/` (events, machine-id) |

If you installed via `cargo install`, also run:

```bash
cargo uninstall tlink
```

To restore your PATH, remove `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` from your shell config (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.).
